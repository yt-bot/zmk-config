# QWERTY fork of urob's zmk config

This config is work in progress. The keymap image does not reflect the current keymap.

Notable changes:

- QWERTY layout
- has separate layers for english and swedish layouts, for linux and macos
  - the keyboard layout should be set to en-us on the host computer
- has a separate symbol layer in addition to the original combos

TODO:

- remove/replace windows macros from config
- add navigation layers for left hand usage
- remove unused combos
