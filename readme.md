# A heavily modified and currently untested fork of urob's zmk config

Using this config isn't advisable.

The keymap image does not reflect the current keymap. Some of the combos do not work, and the typing layers have additional mod taps which likely break more combos.

Notable changes:

- QWERTY layout
- has separate layers for english and swedish layouts, for linux and macos.
  - the keyboard layout should be set to en-us on the host computer
- has mod taps for ?!"-_;:\ keys in typing layers

TODO:

- remove/replace windows macros from config
- add navigation layers for left hand usage
- remove unused combos
